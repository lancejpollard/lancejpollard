## Work Projects

At work for the past 5+ years I have been doing mostly React.js (v16-18) and TypeScript, with GraphQL APIs, working on SaaS products on the Frontend as a **Senior / Staff Frontend Engineer**. I was lucky enough to be an early or so employee at @segmentio back in the day when component.js was the new hotness and React had barely come onto the scene. I have avoided becoming a manager up til today because I like focusing purely on code and implementations, and getting things done in that regard. Maybe one day I'll try management, I just fear it to some degree for some reason. I like to be a part of groups of people who are self motivated, and management isn't necessary. Segment was like that (though we had managers for purity's sake). But I like working with managers as well, they make life easier in many ways when part of such an intrinsically motivated team.

I love working at startups or large companies with a freeing sort of startup vibe (working in smallish teams) because you can build powerful things quickly, even if the deployment cycle isn't necessarily "deploy every 5 minutes", that's okay. I focus mainly on the Frontend, working closely with Product managers and Design leads, as well as the frontend and backend teams. I like the frontend so I can learn better to think like a designer, without going design full-time. I have some backend experience from a while back, but wouldn't be your go-to guy for a backend/infra-heavy project these days.

## Side Projects

On the side over the years I have made a few simple side projects, mostly in Node.js or Next.js hosted on Vercel, though I am tinkering with one that needs to go lower-level than Vercel and use Google Cloud Platform, specifically the serverless Google Cloud Run. I want to get more backend/full-stack experience (again, it's been a while, 2010-era-ish), so hacking on side projects which use some of that more, alongside the nice and clean and simple Vercel/Next.js frontend app.

I also spent a few years during 2017-2018 focusing full time on Computer Science, Algorithms, Data Structures, Math, Type Theory, Compilers, Operating System fundamentals, and Programming Languages, so I could try and create my ideal programming language. Working at startups is a place to use the machete and hack through the weeds in uncharted but profitable new territory, like the old explorers. Side projects such as these provides me a place to explore the more "research and development" side of me, and spend a bit more time studying theory and absorbing the beauty rather than just plowing through the forest with the machete.

But anyways, here's some things I've hacked on over the years.

Finally, follow [@VictorTaelin](https://twitter.com/VictorTaelin) if you're not already, on [GitHub](https://github.com/VictorTaelin) and [Twitter](https://twitter.com/VictorTaelin). After digging into programming languages years ago I ran into his full-fleged theorem-proving-capable functional language [Kind](https://github.com/HigherOrderCO/Kind), which now has a massively parallel functional runtime in Rust to back it up, [HVM](https://github.com/HigherOrderCO/HVM). Those two projects, built upon the ideas of [Interaction Nets](https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/Interaction-Combinators-Lafont/6cfe09aa6e5da6ce98077b7a048cb1badd78cc76), seem to perfectly slve the problem of building an optimal programmiing language (even though I would prefer imperative over functional designs haha!). So I'm watching that like a hawk, waiting for the day it takes over the web :). You should too!
