  I don't read any news websites.<br/>
  I don't listen to any podcasts.<br/>
  I don't watch any TV.<br/>

  If you have the truth and you are on the right, I want to talk to you.<br/>
  If you have the truth and you are on the left, I want to talk to you.<br/>
  Otherwise I will keep on thinking, detached from the community stream, and figure out a model myself.
