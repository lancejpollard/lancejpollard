Hi, my name is Lance. I find great interest in open source, startups, computer science, math, language, the universe, and the mind.

I recently have open sourced Hanakana.js, an script with a prototype font for cross-language writing and pronunciation.

Making movement toward the center.

Working on models of computation and working full time and hanging out with my wonderful wife.
